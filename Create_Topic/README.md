# Create Topic

In ROS 2, topics serve as communication channels facilitating the exchange of messages between nodes in a robotic system. Each topic is associated with a specific message type, dictating the structure of the data being transmitted. Nodes can publish messages to topics or subscribe to topics to receive messages, enabling seamless coordination and collaboration among different components of the robot. This topic-based messaging system promotes modularity, flexibility, and scalability in ROS 2 projects, allowing developers to build complex robotic systems with ease.
